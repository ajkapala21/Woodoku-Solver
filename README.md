# Woodoku-Solver

It took this solver 3 games to beat our highest scores that we had acheived over years of playing.

Built essentially using a MVC format.
The main classes are GameState, which acts as a model and contains all data for a game
                     GameController, which acts as a controller and makes changes to the GameState
                     BoardDisplay, which acts as the view for the game and creates the display for the game.
