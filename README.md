# Woodoku-Solver

It took this solver 3 games to beat our highest scores that we had acheived over years of playing.

Built essentially using a MVC format.
The main classes are 1. GameState, which acts as a model and contains all data for a game.
                     2. GameController, which acts as a controller and makes changes to the GameState.
                     3. BoardDisplay, which acts as the view for the game and creates the display for the game.
                     
The Form1.cs file is the main driver for the program and uses the above classes to do its job.
